I shall be fine. This here is my entrance into a public life on the internet. Everyone will know who i am by this blog. Do I care? Should I care?....You tell me.

Anyways, once in a while i shall come here and write my thoughts about data science. I shall talk about a few tools that have really helped me in my work life as a data person. Most of if not all of what i write about here will be based on the R programming language. Thats not to say that i dont use and appreciate other tools. It's just that you can do everything statistics in R i.e 

* data collection using [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) and a couple of API libraries
* data cleaning using [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [janitor](http://sfirke.github.io/janitor/)
* exploratory data analysis using [DataExplorer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DataExplorer/vignettes/dataexplorer-intro.html), [Visdat](http://visdat.njtierney.com/)
* statistical inference using [moderndive](https://moderndive.com/index.html) and [infer](https://infer.netlify.com/)
* data visualisation using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
* data analysis presentation using Rmarkdown
                                      
Btw, this website is built using [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). Just goes to show you how powerful R is.

To sum this all up (before i start talking too much), there is an online book called [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). It's an accronym that stands for **"R for Data Science."** and is written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)It will teach you the 20% you need to do 80% of your data related work with R.

Till next time, i remain truly yours...hehe.
