Good day my friend. Today i would like about **Reproducible Research**.

One thing i learnt early in life is that if you understand the definition of a subject, then you have overcome the biggest hurdle there is to ever understanding the concept therein (I hope that makes sense) .

The best definition i could find that explains the concept is this:

> [**Reproducible Research**](https://www.ctspedia.org/do/view/CTSpedia/ReproducibleResearchStandards) is the practice of distributing, along with a research publication, all data, software source code, and tools required to reproduce the results discussed in the publication.  -  [orgmode.org](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html)

In a nutshell, this means that the analysis process that you undertook can be repeated exactly by another person given the same statistical tools.

I practise reproducible research using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) with [Github](https://github.com/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). i have included links here and i encourage you to visit each of the websites and read up as much as you can because as my dad always said _**"Leaders are Readers"**_.
