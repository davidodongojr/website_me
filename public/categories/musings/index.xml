      <description>I shall be fine. This here is my entrance into a public life on the internet. Everyone will know who i am by this blog. Do I care? Should I care?&amp;hellip;.You tell me.
Anyways, once in a while i shall come here and write my thoughts about data science. I shall talk about a few tools that have really helped me in my work life as a data person. Most of if not all of what i write about here will be based on the R programming language.</description>
