      <description>Good day my friend. Today i would like about Reproducible Research.
One thing i learnt early in life is that if you understand the definition of a subject, then you have overcome the biggest hurdle there is to ever understanding the concept therein (I hope that makes sense) .
The best definition i could find that explains the concept is this:
 Reproducible Research is the practice of distributing, along with a research publication, all data, software source code, and tools required to reproduce the results discussed in the publication.</description>
